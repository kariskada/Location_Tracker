# Location Tracker
Real-time Tracking Bus System

#Main_Agenda
Passengers often face challenges such as uncertainty about bus arrival times, lengthy waits at bus stops, and difficulty in navigating unfamiliar routes. To address these issues and enhance the quality of public transportation services, we propose the development and implementation of a Real-Time Tracking Bus System.
Real-time bus tracking system is a technology that enables users to monitor the current location, movement, and estimated time of arrival of buses. The system uses a variety of technology, including GPS (Global Positioning System), mobile network, sensors, and software, to provide passengers and other stakeholders with accurate and up-to-date information on the bus whereabouts. Buses are equipped with GPS devices that continuously transmit real-time location data. This data is received by a central server, allowing the location of each bus to be accurately tracked. Users can access real-time bus tracking information through a mobile app. This information includes the busâ€™s current location, estimated time of arrival, route details, and other potentially relevant information such as traffic conditions.
